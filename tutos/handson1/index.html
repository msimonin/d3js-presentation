      <h1>Hands-on 1 : DOM/SVG manipulations</h1>
      Modify the source file to use D3 and get this behaviour :
      <p>
        When loading the page
        <ul>
          <li>a svg element is inserted in the DOM</li>
          <li>10 circles appear </li>
          <li>then, after some time, each of them is transitioned to a zero-radius circle</li>
          <li>then, then after some time, each of them is removed from the DOM</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      Note : You'll use a for loop to generate the 10 circles. It's definitely
      not a good practice with D3js (see data join section).
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Javascript and D3js code here
